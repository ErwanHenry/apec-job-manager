# Product Development Style Guide

## Development Philosophy
- **MVP-first**: Prefer rapid MVP development with measurable success criteria
- **Iterative improvement**: Build → Measure → Learn → Iterate
- **User-centric**: Every feature must solve a real user problem
- **Data-driven**: Decisions based on metrics and user feedback
- **Security by design**: Build security considerations into every feature

## Feature Specifications

### Required Components
- **Problem statement**: Clear description of user pain point
- **Success metrics**: Quantifiable measures of feature success
- **User stories**: "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance criteria**: Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Risk assessment**: Technical, business, and security risks
- **Scope definition**: What's included and explicitly excluded

### User Story Format
```
As a [BlablaKAS driver/passenger/KAScomodation guest/host]
I want [specific functionality]  
So that [clear benefit or goal]
```

### Acceptance Criteria Template
```
Given [initial context/state]
When [action is performed]
Then [expected outcome]
```

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **RBAC minimum**: Role-Based Access Control for all user actions
- **Principle of least privilege**: Users get minimum necessary permissions
- **Session management**: Secure session handling with timeouts
- **Multi-factor authentication**: For administrative and sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- **Audit logs**: Comprehensive logging of all user actions and system events
- **Data encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Privacy by design**: Minimize data collection, respect user consent
- **GDPR compliance**: Right to deletion, data portability, consent management

### Technical Security
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS protection**: Output encoding and CSP headers
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage
- **Code review**: All code must be peer reviewed
- **Documentation**: API documentation and inline code comments
- **Performance**: Response times <200ms for critical paths

### Architecture Principles
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **API-first**: RESTful APIs with consistent patterns
- **Database per service**: No shared databases between services
- **Event-driven**: Use events for service communication

## Integration Requirements

### BlablaKAS-Specific
- **Real-time updates**: Live ride tracking and status updates
- **Payment processing**: Secure payment handling with multiple providers
- **Geolocation**: GPS tracking with privacy controls
- **Communication**: In-app messaging with safety features

### KAScomodation-Specific  
- **Booking system**: Calendar integration and availability management
- **Property management**: Multi-property support with unified dashboard
- **Guest communication**: Automated messaging with personalization
- **Revenue optimization**: Dynamic pricing and occupancy management

## Performance Targets

### Response Times
- **API endpoints**: <200ms average
- **Page loads**: <1 second initial load
- **Real-time features**: <100ms latency
- **Database queries**: <50ms average

### Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling**: Design for cloud-native scaling
- **Load handling**: Support 10x current load without performance degradation
- **Database optimization**: Efficient queries and proper indexing
- **Caching strategy**: Multi-layer caching (CDN, application, database)

## Deployment & Operations

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Security scanning**: Vulnerability assessment in pipeline
- **Staging environment**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Blue-green deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Application metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Business metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates, revenue impact
- **Security monitoring**: Failed logins, suspicious activities
- **Infrastructure monitoring**: Server health, database performance

## Documentation Requirements

### Technical Documentation
- **API documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Architecture diagrams**: System design and data flow
- **Database schemas**: ERD and table documentation
- **Deployment guides**: Step-by-step deployment instructions

### User Documentation
- **Feature announcements**: Clear communication of new capabilities
- **User guides**: Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- **FAQ updates**: Address common questions and issues
- **Release notes**: Summary of changes and improvements
